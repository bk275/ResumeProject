### Archetype Exploration - Start Here

In this assignment, you're tasked with exploring and expressing your unique **archetype**. Your archetype is a universally relatable symbol or character, such as the 'Hero', 'Artist', 'Caregiver', 'Explorer', 'Rebel', and many more. This personal symbol will form the backbone of your design strategy, reflecting in your choice of background image, fonts, and color scheme for your resume.

### Unleashing the Power of CSS 

CSS is the paintbrush to your canvas of HTML, giving you the means to adjust layouts, add colors, modify fonts, and much more. It's how you transform your functional webpage into an interactive and visually pleasing digital experience.

Your mission in this assignment is to upgrade your plain HTML resume with CSS, making it not only accessible but visually appealing. Your goal is to create a site that represents you professionally and engages anyone who visits it.

## Assignment Deliverables and Grading

1. A CSS-enhanced version of your resume that reflects your chosen archetype in its design.
2. A screenshot of your styled resume, embedded in the Readme.md file of your assignment's GitHub repository.
3. In the Readme file, include your name, and a short explanation of your design choices in relation to your archetype, and a screenshot of your resume.  You should also inlcude this, if you post your resume to the discussion board.  **[See my Example](example.md)**  Remove all of the code in the existing Readme.md file, so that it's easy for the grader to see.  **You will get a 0 if you keep the original content in the readme.md.**

### Important Considerations for Grading 

- Please review the code comments in the web page for guidance. Access it [here](src/index.html).
- For this assignment, concentrate on enhancing color, typography, and images. Refrain from introducing layout modifications, as we will delve into this in the subsequent module.
- Aim for elegant simplicity in your design. Exploring CSS beyond the scope of this assignment is not required or encouraged.
- Make sure you thoroughly review all the content that I am providing, it really will help you become a better technologist, communicator, and designer.  
- Make sure you use a "Creative Commons" or an Ai Generated image (Ai Images don't have a copywright). Cite the source of your image and read the licensing requirements of the image to make sure you can legally use it.

### Grading Rubric - All or Nothing

**Your assignment will be assessed based on:**

1. The presence of a screenshot of the resume in the Readme.md file. Assignments without this will be marked as zero with no option for resubmission.
2. The professional styling of your resume and its representation of the chosen brand archetype. Inadequate attempts will receive a zero score.  You have the opportunity for feedback through the discssion board, if you can get a draft of the assignment done at least 3 days before the due date.
3. Must pass all Playwright tests
