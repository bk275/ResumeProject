# John Doe's Styled Resume

In designing my resume, I chose to embody the 'Explorer' archetype. Defined by their adventurous spirit, explorers are fearless, independent, and always on the quest for new experiences.

I selected 'Work Sans', a modern, sans-serif typeface, for my resume. This versatile and easy-to-read font resonates with the no-nonsense, straightforward approach often seen in explorers. I also used varying sizes for the headers to reflect the dynamic and varied nature of an explorer's experiences.

For my color scheme, I used a monochromatic palette of dark gray (`#333`) and a muted shade of brown (`#7B6F63`). Monochromatic colors are shades, tones, and tints within the same hue, providing a harmonious and cohesive look. The dark gray represents the grounded and bold aspects of an explorer, while the muted brown, reminiscent of earthy trails, speaks to the explorer's connection with nature.

The background image of a river serves as a fitting backdrop, illustrating the environment that explorers often find themselves in and evoking feelings of adventure and the thrill of the unknown.
