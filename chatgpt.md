## Disclaimer about using ChatGPT

**While ChatGPT is a powerful tool for answering questions and providing explanations, please remember it's an artificial intelligence model developed by OpenAI and not a human expert. It's trained on a diverse range of internet text, but it doesn't know everything and may not always provide accurate or complete information. 

If you notice an answer from ChatGPT that doesn't seem right or doesn't make sense, don't hesitate to ask for clarification, double-check the information using other resources, or ask your instructor or peers. It's all part of the learning process! 

Also, keep in mind that as of September 2021, ChatGPT has not been trained with information or updates about technology or programming languages released after this date.**
